## The challenge

Make a public repository on github.com. It should be named shell-work, under the alias you choose. It has to be initialized with a file named README.md, which will contain at least a line containing the repository name preceded by a '#'.

This repository will be the root folder for your work from now on. Each exercice should be submitted in it's own folder, named after the exercice number (ex02 for example).

You will validate your solution with \`shell-work verify <your-repository-url>\`.

The "commit", "Author" and "Date" lines won't be taken into account.
